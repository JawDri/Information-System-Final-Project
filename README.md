This repository contains my full documentations of the Information System Final Project

The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) is a public and a non-administrative company, it is responsible for delivering electricity and gas across Tunisia. The company suffered tremendous losses in the order of 200 million Tunisian Dinars due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers.

Using the client’s billing history, the aim of the challenge is to detect and recognize counters involved in fraudulent activities.

The solution will enhance the company’s revenues and reduce the losses caused by such fraudulent activities.
